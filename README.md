# Screams of reddit

## Prologue
Based on a question raised by Varun Grover

`Hum aise kyun hai`

Translation

`why are we(indians) like this`

## Why

This is the quest to find out why are we like this. What general opion we have.
I dont wanna take a swim into hot stinking pile of what indian spaces of quora has become.

## How

Reddit is primarily a discussion based  social media so why not scrape its data, parse it
and to feed it to algorithms like word2vec to study the spectrum.
