| No point sweating over it now OP. Just remember to be generous and more considerate in the future.
-| Thank you!
--| It's your willingness to pay. https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/willingness-to-pay#:~:text=What%20Is%20Willingness%20to%20Pay,for%20a%20product%20or%20service.&text=While%20potential%20customers%20are%20likely,t%20pay%20a%20higher%20price.

You have been conditioned to think that the rickshaw ride should not cost that much. You are also conditioned to think that bargain is allowed if not encouraged. You are in a scenario where you don't care about what others will think of you when you bargain. You have the alternative to just walk or get something more expensive simply because you think it would be worth  the extra expense.

None of these are circumstances created by you. As a person you just want to make the best of the situation..now it seems that some values are at higher priority for you than just saving money or getting the best deal and that's also fine. The rickshaw guy tries to make the best of the situation in his own way. You are not responsible for him making his livelihood. Or doing justice or whatever moral ideology you relate to. As the article concludes in the end, he just has to get it right.
---| This!

I kind of 're-programmed' myself on this. Otherwise, it will happen with everyone.

The question I generally ask myself: If I pay 10 Rs more, will I have any problem in life? Every time, the answer has been a 'No'. So without any hesitation, I do this now.
----| You increase the price for everyone else though.

Taking this to the extreme: Imagine if Ambani brought all the stock of some rare medicine; it wouldnt hit his networth for shit. But it would jack up the price for everyone else who needs it.
-----| >You increase the price for everyone else though.

Why is that a moral problem for you, when exploiting the vulnerable autowalla or vegetable vendor isn't?
------| Its not exploiting. Just like the customer can choose not to take a service the provider can choose to not offer.

And they arent ever offering less than markets so theres no chance of exploitation. Public Transport unions hold good political sway everywhere so he isnt gonna offer a 20Rs trip for 10.

The only time a vegetable vendor goes below market rates is to either take a competitive edge or cause his products are nearing expiry. I dont get where you get the idea of retail customers "exploiting" a vegetable vender lol.
------| Why do you assume that only the autowalla or vegetable vender can be vulnerable and not their customers ? More often than not the same autowalla is buying vegetables from that vegetable vender and that vegetable vender is taking ride from that autowalla.
 If you ruin the basic economy of supply and demand, both of them will suffer and you will be abetting the exploitation of the same people who you are trying to protect.
There are some places where you are expected to bargain, even at a pizza place or a burger place that's why they have coupons.
        it is a basic duty of everyone to participate in that bargaining rituals, its not like the autowalla or vegetable vender is selling his services for the first time or he is stupid , even he knows this basic marketing and has therefore increased his price accordingly.
 It is plane and simple marketing, so don't be so judgemental and emotional about it. 

Let the micro economy work. 

If you really do feel too generous, perhaps you can donate to a charity who specialises in helping those in need.
But doling out money and ruining the fix prices of things often hurt poors the most.
Show generosity as a mean to help a person out and not to boost your ego.
-------| >More often than not the same autowalla is buying vegetables from that vegetable vender and that vegetable vender is taking ride from that autowalla. 

And both of them can afford to pay each other better, if they get paid fair wages by people like you and me. 

In all the rant you've written, you've completely ignored the fact that people in the most vulnerable positions get bargained down to exploitative positions in unregulated "free" markets.
--------| >In all the rant you've written

Dude, just because you don't like something that doesn't automatically becomes e a rant, the points I raised are fairly obvious and expected to be asked. 

2ndly,


>And both of them can afford to pay each other better, if they get paid fair wages by people

First of all they are not your regular wage employee, you are just a one time customer who is paying 10rs extra, while majority of his customers are some poor or middle class people who can't afford that extra 10 rs.
2ndly, it is market place and regulating prices is never a good idea, it only breeds corruption.
3rdly, both of them can't really afford to pay each other better because thats not how market works, wages will increase only when macroeconomic situations change.
Lastly, Instead of advocating for price regulations and reliance on one time generosity of stranger, which will. Probably further deteriorate the situation,
If you really care about that person, you should be advocating for better social security, and health benefits for that person, which could actually help him in real and permanent terms.
---| I’m a foreigner with a deep interest in India, and when I first came there rickshaw drivers would charge me and my friends 180 rupees each for a short drive taking advantage of the fact that we didn’t know what the prices are on average. 

So I do agree that everybody tries to make the best out of the situation.
----| And they rightfully did charge that. This "taking advantage" was their only way to get anything remotely close to a fair wage.
-----| They are not on wage.. they are self employed.
------| Wage != salary

-| Bengaluru has entered the chat
--| Sir oneandhalf
---| Naale Baa, evattu raja.
----| Kundi mat khadkao raja..
-----| 😂😂😂😂😂
---| Ptsd
---| You lucky bastard. They've progressed from asking for 200rs when it should be 75 rs by meter to asking for uber surge rates. oneandhalf is a steal.
--| I was in Bengaluru some years back, I was not in a mood to walk back 2KM so I asked one auto rikshaw driver without hesitation he said 400. I laughed out took the yulu and it costed me 40. They are going to start crying in sometime and demand shutdown of these companies instead of changing there behaviour.
---| They recently beat rapido drivers. Nd created drama against rapido company.
----| Every transition starts with violence. All over the world. Taxi drivers in European countries damaged cars driven by Uber drivers in protest. In my suburb in Thane (MH), when I grew up there was no meter and there was a time when rickshaw drivers not running by meter beat up those running by meter because they set “bad examples”, but now they all run by meter like in Mumbai.  

Because inevitably there comes a time when too many customers want the new product / new service / new way of treating customers and every Tom, Dick and Harry must adapt or perish.
---| In bengaluru, auto drivers polish their ego on you!
---| 400! Holy shit which area. I have been quoted ridiculous prices near brigade and MG road but never this for 2 Kms
----| It was MG road indeed, may be they thought I'm not from Bengaluru or something don't know, but at one instance they asked for 150 something for 2-3KM these two were the only time I used Auto Rikshaw there.
-----| Did you ask in Hindi? They charge extra for translation :p
------| Yeah, :D I guess that added another 100 rupee.
-----| Once they know you’re new there, their eyes start flashing
----| Try mg Road when it's raining.
--| I was once in Bangalore, and had to go to a place some 4kms away. Driver quoted Rs 200 had to come back empty and plus it was raining - I said no as walked it out. 
Next day there was no rain, the driver said 200 again because he had to come back early and when I told him he quoted 200 the previous day because of rain - he literally said it’s too sunny today hence it’s 200 🙈
---| I don't get their logic of increasing in rain time.

My senior once had a 9am class, and was running late, her car didn't start. So she tried going by auto.
She has used auto before and the standard price from her home to college is 100rs.(7km)
But this time they asked her 500rs. She's a localite, and thr auto driver lived nearby and knew who she was.
She refused and made her husband drive her to college. 

Reason given by auto guy was Rain. Location chamarajanagara.
If rain made the fees 5x, me who is from near Mangalore, where it rains 6 months per year, would go bankrupt if I ever used auto....
----| > senior

*Weird confused noises*
-----| People get married while doing degree. There were a few in my batch who got married during the 3rd and a few in the final year.
----| The Rain thing is just a way to exploit the customer's situation. It is a subtle way of saying - get in or get wet.
--| Speaking of Bengaluru and meters i have bad memories with double meter ffs.
--| meter nhi chlta hai.... every damn rickshaw
--| I don't even know why they have them attached
---| Fashion
--| LOL I remember my mom offering the auto driver extra for meter
--| Come to my shop
--| 😭
--| Last 3 times I've taken an auto they've used the meter. The only time one guy didn't was yesterday when I was returning a little late (around midnight) and he said 100 for a 4km trip. I thought that was fair as Ola was showing 114.
-| I have been to lot of cities in India and found only in Mumbai they follow the meters. In most of other cities its just a showpiece.
--| In Ahmedabad they used to. Not sure now
-| OP is talking about an E-rickshaw, which is different from an autorickshaw.

E-rickshaws are very popular in Delhi and don't have a meter, as far as I know.
--| What's the minimum charge?
---| depends completely on the driver but at least in my city, the fare can be as low as ₹5/-
---| in my area the min i have seen is rs 20 just to get to market abt 1 km away
--| That's right.
--| >E-rickshaws 

Electric ones?
---| yep
----| Interesting. I wonder why they do not use meters.
-----| most of them are customized and installing a meter means they have to run by the book and who wants that?
------| Okay, that sounds illegal though.
-------| it is....also they always overload passengers on their flimsy rickshaws
--------| And that sounds unsafe! Damn!
-----| I don't think they have license plates and rto registrations. Not sure where they stand in terms of road legality.

Also just came across this article from last year.

www.indiatimes.com/amp/trending/social-relevance/e-rickshaw-registration-supreme-court-order-533906.html
------| Interesting.
------| I checked the date on that article to see if it was April fools joke. It wasn't. Simply the supreme court being supreme joke.
-| Not everywhere. But i don't bargain in any case.
--| Yep, Not bargaining actually makes me satisfied because that sum of money didn't matter much to me but it's good money for the small servicemen/sellers.

But i do bargain from the shops from whom I am making a huge bill and as a customer ask of some discount.
-| Have you ever seen the "Touch me Not" sign on riskshaw metres? Apparently even the rickshaw wallas don't touch it.
-| Bambai nahi hain delhi
-| E rickshaw’s don’t have a meter
--| No Meter? Then bargaining is fair game.
---| r/UsernameChecksOut
-| I think he is talking of cycle rickshaw, not auto rickshaw that's why it's so cheap (20 Rs). They don't have meters. And for auto-rickshaws too, except for few cities like Mumbai, many cities in India (Delhi, Bangalore) auto drivers don't agree to meters.
-| Difference between an "auto" and an "e-rickshaw"
-| Hello Mumbai
-| I've seen meter run rickshaws only in Mumbai.
-| e-rickshaws don't have a meter, and autos don't usually run by the meter.
| I stopped bargaining near vegetable vendors a long time ago, most of them recognise me here and they don't cheat/scam anyways.
-| I'm not making up this story. It really happened to me 

I once was at a small street vendor while traveling. I asked how much the product is. He said 60. I immediately gave him 60.

He actually returned me 10 saying he quoted higher earlier because many people bargain and pay less. And he don't want to over charge me.
--| God bless that man
--| Yeah vendors often mark up price of vegetables expecting customers to bargain but they never try to cheat on their customers.
--| I used to take Ola regularly to office and the fare used to be around 220-250. One time I booked at an odd hour (2pm or something) and it was 131. The distance is around 19kms and I knew that guy wasn't even getting his diesel money from that trip so I paid 150 and was getting out and the driver was insisting that I take the change. I had to walk away fast after repeating that it's fine for him to keep it. This was probably around 2018.
|  If one earns well enough, should one be more considerate of the lesser privileged like street vendors, etc. and not try to bargain with them, especially since many families are in desperation due to the lockdowns and the impact of COVID in general?

Yes
-| I agree, but it begs a question as others have pointed out. Won't that make such services a bit more expensive for other people, if a lot of people start doing this? What do you think?
--| What about the expensive restaurant you visited? Did you think the same thing for it too?

For each restaurant, there will be a roadside stall there for the lesser privileged too. That's just how the market works.

If you say that it will drive up the prices for rickshaws, if the market needs it, some cheaper versions will come up. Plus, in reality, rickshaws are anyways the cheaper versions of taxis. 

So no, if you give some money over the asking price to rickshaw walas, it won't drive up prices overall.
---| Rickshaw licenses are regulated, hence it's not a fair price for the consumers too. If regulators decided there were only 100 Covid19 vaccines available in India, what would happen to the price?
---| Restaurants are known to have different prices.
Rich people go to expensive ones, poor people go to roadside ones. It's a spectrum.

If rich people gave 10rs extra to auto drivers, then that auto driver will want go charge 10rs extra to everyone. It'll affect the poor. 10rs may not be much to you. But it is for poor people. 10rs can get you a big pack of parle-g which is entire lunch for some poor people.
There's no special poor people auto that charges less.

Moreover, you're paying for the environment and service in an expensive restaurant. It doesn't change in auto. It's the same broken auto, in same pothole filled roads...
--| Get some add on service instead of paying more for the same service. Pay extra and ask them to give the best selection of vegetables for example.
--| People who are fortunate enough to pay full price should do so ( for small vendors ), because most people can't and they often bargain. If you think they're overcharging then sure you can ask for a discount.
---| Will you ask a discount from the Pizza shop? Or from a jewelry shop? You know where to show your miser mindset. You are taking 10rs away from a rickshaw guy That is how I see it.
----| But honestly, we just choose to not go to such places, right? If we know someone is overcharging, the price is for the ambience, the crowd, etc.
----| I have definitely bargained at jewelers. I have also asked pizza places for discount codes because fuck paying full price for a pizza. The more expensive the item the more I bargain.
--| It will just create oversupply of said service providers and thus in turn will eventually drive down the price. If the customer is willing to pay the premium for the said service eventually competition will come, and undercut the said supplier of the service, to gain market share and in turn drive down the price.
---| That doesn’t happen in real life tho…
----| It happens always every time, ever run a retail business?
--| I am a NRI, so whenever I come back I spend a bit freely. I have found myself haggling occassionally with some auto rickshaws etc too very occasionally out of impulse (mostly because growing up that's the expectation, that the auto-wallah will quote something ridiculous and you will bring it back to reality). What I have done in such scenarios is if the auto/ rickshaw driver took me home safely, I will pay them a little bit extra to agreed rate as a "tip". I also try to tip generously in Uber and Zomato. 

&#x200B;

> Won't that make such services a bit more expensive for other people, if a lot of people start doing this?

Of course, I feel a lot of pressure on this especially when tipping maids as family and neighbors get preachy on how I am "changing their expectations and they will start asking for more". (1) I don't think that's a bad thing. (2) I am yet to see any evidence of that happening from few folks being generous.
--| Should you be more considerate-- yes, depending on your privilege vs that of the person offering service.

Does it make services expensive for other people-- No, people will pay as per their capacity. There isn't a single price, and the prices are not decided based on what a few people pay.
--| If paying fair wages for labour means others will have to do the same, isn't that a good thing?
--| That's good for them then. At least the money will go to poor people creating more equality. I mean a small dip at kfc costs like 35rs itself. I wouldn't mind spending 10rs extra if that money is going to someone who's barely eating thrice a day and probably sleeping in a tent. 

Besides you don't worry about "everyone paying more" that'll never happen. If someone rich enough to spend 2k on an evening would think twice then there would be millions of people that'll continue to bargain no matter what. I don't mean that in an offensive way though, just pointing it out that it'll never happen
| I really don't bargain for things under 200 .. that's my number now ig... And never bargained for auto rikshaw ride, i feel at my place it's already very cheap.
| > Why did I bargain for 10 rupees after spending 2k and not batting an eye? 

Because you can do that to the auto driver. And bargaining in the restaurant will make you look undignified.

EDIT: Middle class ego is a thing.
-| Even i have this thing, amd i hate that its a thing
--| What is middle class Ego?
---| not wanting to look poor/undignified around ppl u think are frm higher class but are also just more middle class ppl lol
--| Easiest way to deal with it is to do the bargaining to stroke your ego, and then pay the asking price.
-| very bourgeois of you.
-| That's utter nonsense. You won't bargain at a restaurant because restaurants don't allow bargaining. It's simple as that. It's society and business convention and nothing to do with ego. If you could bargain at restaurants, people would bargain at restaurants.
--| This seems correct
| Its ok. We all make mistakes. Its not like you agreed to pay 30 and then paid only 20. You didnt cheat or robbed anyone. But probably you shouldn't have bargained.
-| There is no right answer to this question  other than it’s a market failure . Unless we fix systemic issues with market which determines price and value, everyone’s feels feels they got wrong end of the stick .
--| How is this a Failure? 
This is how preciesly a value of a service is determined.
Both parties agree based on demand and Supply.

Is there a problem with market like competition in auto drivers?
---| classic example of someone living by textbook and not by life. bruh, OP means that those 10 bucks wouldn't have meant jackshit to him since he was coming back from sending 2k for a meal, but those 10 bucks are quite a bit for a rickshaw man. fuck your logic, have some humanity lol
| It's simple, we always do relative comparison.
e.g. On a book of 100 Rs, you will probably walk a bit to get Rs 20 discount.
But for a TV worth 20k a difference of Rs 50 will not make you walk the same distance.
This is not a unique thing that you did and don't feel bad about it. If Rs 20 was unfair to the riskshaw driver then next time be mindful to err on the side of kindness.
-| Read about this last sem in my Money, Banking and Finance class. Damn interesting how our brains function. It's included in Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky.
| I had the same realization a few years ago. I had picked up the habit of unnecessary haggling and scarcity mindset from my parents, who are well of doctors  

It was late at night in Delhi, and I was with a lady friend waiting for an auto near select city mall.  After about an half hour of waiting an auto showed up . He was asking for 100rs and I was trying to be hoshiyar and bargain for 20rs. After a few minutes my friend said : we spent money for a movie and food, it's middle of the night and you'd rather save 20rs than get home safely. Just say yes and get in you idiot. 

That was an a-ha moment for may and now I almost never bargain with vendors, auto-wallahs, shopkeepers unless it's an obvious blatant rip-off.

Good on you OP for changing your habits.
| Wait. It’s not legal to run a taxi/rickshaw without meter right?

Ohhk. It’s Delhi. Mumbai has meter only system.
-| In bangalore, it's illegal to charge by the meter.
--| This made me laugh hysterically. Thanks
-| I have never seen a rickshaw with meter, i live in MP
-| Only in The selected Cities.
Most times you bargain before getting in the vehicle.
| Since I’m earning good and enough I’ve started tipping 20-30% off the fare to auto drivers. I don’t know why I started doing this. But it feels good.
-| Tip them at the start of rides. You will get a nice friendly chat and they will treat you like a King.
| It's ok. Countless rickshaw has scammed me so they can take one time.
-| lol,

Had to see this one coming
| The Indian mindset. We want poor people to stay poor so we get cheap labor. We pay toll, fuel, etc etc without question. But we want to get auto cheap. We cannot bargain going to a mall. But we feel entitled to bargain on the footpath.
-| Well that is not anyhow only Indian mindset...
-| So you imply that this is Indian Mindset and Non-Indian people dont have such Things?
--| Exactly. Log thoda bhi sochte nahi hai bolne ke pehle. Matlab apna bias thoda toh check kar lo.. Lol
-| America enters the discussion....
--| You can live quite decently on American minimum wage, you can pay rent dress well and eat good food. In India uhm well you're fucked basically
-| At least for me, it was almost instinctive!
--| The govt, the fuel companies, the beurocracy , all are great time screwing us systamically.. can we bargain to them?
| What you did is RIGHT. Here's why

The place where you didn't bargain, you know the price is transparent and you know everyone pays the same, so you don't see a point in bargaining

However in places where they don't publish or be transparent about prices, they charge depending who you are or how you look. Remember the time when your mum got veggies versus your dad? My dad always paid atleast 20% more because he didn't bargain, and got the worst selection

I experienced this first hand when I was software engineer in Pune. Street vendors only sell to IT employees because they don't care about prices and just pay whatever is asked. My landlord who is a government employee also realized this and told me "I just go to super market these days, because these vendors are quoting prices that are just ridiculous. It is but of walk, but we prices are transparent and reasonable"

That said, you or wouldn't negotiate with a rickshaw that has meter or a street vendor that has price card
-| You make good points, however you also need to consider that most street vendors will take up any bargain as long as it brings some income to their household. Theres nothing wrong with bargaining but considering the current situation we need to be mindful that we do so without taking advantage of their desperation. 
I agree OP had every right to bargain and I understand his ethical dilema..
--| There's a farmers market in Hyderabad I used to go to. Farmers set one price and you don't get to bargain or pick yourself. It is always crowded, and I'm sure farmers were happy to avoid middlemen and set their own price. You set a price high or low outright, and there's always someone to buy

That said, I hate when people take advantage of vendors who are in desperate situations. And I also hate vendors who cheat buyers on price, and indirectly influence them to bargain next time they buy something
---| Thats a nice idea!
-| I second this.
-| I don’t give a shit about paying 20% extra to poor people. I’d rather they have that 50 rupees with him that me. Cuz they need it more than I do. People are just greedy that’s all. 

Iphones also have extremely higj profit margin. And apple has billions in cash reserves. They don’t even need the money. Yet we’ll make excuses to pay poor people less.
--| What happens to the other poor person who wants to use the same service? Whom do think vendor prefers when you stand in line with the poor person? Now let's say if a vendor charges the same for you both, how do you think his preference between you too changes

At times you have to give a shit, and maybe some thought. Your intentions might be good, but they ain't helping anyone, not even you
| I don't think you should feel guilty for that. One, rickshaws are supposed to charge according to fare meter. Two, you paying more would mean that next guy who might not be as fortunate as you would be asked for same.
-| Think OP mentioned it in the post . Why he/she didn't question instantly whether the pizza is worth the amount quoted in restaurant but could instantly question the rickshaw driver is the reason for guilt .
-| Yeah this is what I was wondering as well. Would us paying a bit extra not make it more expensive for someone else to buy the same thing?
--| Nope, it will just attract more rickshaw drivers. Plenty of unemployment in India to fill the gap.
--| I will think this is at a bit micro level. You are suppose willing to pay Rs 30 for a service which costs Rs 20 because you can afford to do so. But the next 5 customer for that rickshaw might not be able to do that so probably the rickshaw driver will lose first two customers thinking that they are not paying him fair wage but he might agree to Rs 20 as fare for the latter 3. The supply only increases if the demand exceeds consistently. This scenario is simply a price action problem. 
Now if you think that for a vegetable seller, then it could have different implications because the physical closeness of other customers asking for the same material unlike rickshaw so it is possible that a higher price creates a chain reaction in just an hour of higher price.
--| I think one should not think about second order, third order effects without solid scientific data-driven approach.

When a person supported another by giving some extra money, the first order effect is that the income of the recipient increased. Now there can be many second-order effects, it can increase price of service for others, or since you gave money, it has increased the purchasing power of that guy, he can stimulate the economy by purchasing more goods and many other cases other redditors are proposing.

There can be numerous second-order effects, even more third-order effects and so on. For thinking about that, we will need professional hypothesis testing. At this point we may simply accept that we don't know the outcome of our act of generosity, it might have done harm to others in some nth order effect, but we did it because we felt it right based on first-order consideration.

I am not sure, but i feel worrying about such higher-order effects without proper scientific setup would come under slippery slope fallacy?? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4f7QrfRRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4f7QrfRRc)
-| By that logic, one should be bargaining at restaurants also. Otherwise they would keep increasing prices, right? 

And electric rickshaws or cycle rickshaws don't come with meters. This is not an auto. Cycle rickshaws don't even have batteries! What are you talking about?
--| Makes sense, but don't you think that most people bargain where the rates are not explicit? For example, in a restaurant, the menu is fixed and is in front of you. If you find it too expensive, you won't visit the place again. However, rickshaw drivers (non-metered) don't have this..
---| Yes they do. That's why every rickshaw puller would tell you they would rather be an auto driver. It's much more comfortable, faster and easier to ride. Plus, no hassle of bargaining as there is a meter. 

The problem is they can't afford to rent/buy metered autos. And people not paying them enough is what keeps them in their state.. They are stuck in the situation. 

It's funny that we ask beggars to find some work and when they work, we don't pay them enough! I personally think that if 10/- is not a big deal for someone, they shouldn't be bargaining with them. Just assume you are helping someone.
---| > If you find it too expensive, you won't visit the place again. 

I've walked out of places after being seated because the prices were crazy.
| [deleted]
-| I understand this, but coming from a place of empathy and generosity, don't you think it's okay if they get that extra 10 rs even if you know you are being ripped off? In this time and place when everything is getting more and more expensive, how are people supposed to make a living. Why should we grudge them 10 rs?
--| There are other ways to do charity though.
---| Yeah I know.. and I'm sure many good people do do charity, including me. But this is when it's happening to you and you're not actively seeking to help people. It's like when the opportunity presents itself.
--| Maybe because they're scamming
---| Why are you on my ass everywhere?
----| + proof
-----| Wot
-| Sorry, but the only bullshit comment here is yours sir. You are okay being looted if they do it with everyone and do it openly? It's equivalent to saying bribery is fine because everyone is doing it. Petrol price of 150/- per litre is fine because everyone has it same?

Also, how do you expect a cycle rickshaw driver to fix prices? There don't even have an odometer!
| I think to be objectively correct, you will have to go through all the costs accumulated for each product and service and then draw a conclusion.

However, in these situations, its better to learn and cache responses. For example, next time you get an e-rickshaw, you can pay whatever reasonable amount he asks. Don’t overthink it. Just like you didn’t overthink at the restaurant :)
| You bargained not because of him being an easy target but rather because you wouldn't have felt ashamed if you'd asked the same at the restaurant
| Kudos to OP for being honest! I agree I too feel the same way...We all need to be compassionate to each other during these tough times :)
| A friend of mine did this after a platonic date. She’s not my friend anymore
| What you did is correct...

What you are repenting now, is also correct...
| Why the fuck are you asking us mate, i have enough fifth life crisis already
| Find him and give him rs. 50
| It's a good self introspective question. You seem like a good, empathetic person.

What i end up doing is i rounding up or paying extra 10-20 rupees for the drivers etc because I realize it's tough for them and it has been there last couple of years
| The thing with bargaining is that you should always know the market value of said service/product. And bargain only when you feel it’s over-priced. I don’t know whether you should’ve bargained or not in this case, because the Distance and time taken needs to be considered in this situation. Both of them haven’t been stated in the post,
| Am glad you have this sort of awareness. Thank you for posting.
| Been there, done that friend. I catch myself bargaining with fruit and vegetable vendors for 4-5 rupees, calling them "greedy" for overcharging while on the same day, I go to a coffee shop to pay a bill worth a few hundreds for just some coffee and veg puff
| These over-expensive hotels charge us for the ambience and not just for food. I never really enjoyed going to expensive places to eat simply because I never felt it was worth the money. Occasionally visited expensive places with friends/family who enjoy the ambience (or want to show-off on social media)

Regarding street vendors, I usually prefer giving the quoted amount even if it is 10-20% above my expected value (or market value). However some street vendors loot customers by quoting high prices with high profit margins. I think we should not encourage such loot as it affects other customers as well who might want to purchase but couldn't due to high prices. 

So the point is, you can give 10 20% extra to street vendors considering the inflation and their needs. But there should be a stop loss to it. Otherwise it affects overall market
| If you have miney, don’t fucking bargain with vegetable vendors, pani puri stalls , rickshawwallas , daily labors, and you know who are poor, unless you realize that the guy is a crook and charging you exorbitantly.
| Well everything has its place. bargaining keeps inflation in check. Go to any tourist spot and ask how miserable locals are because of the extravagant prices. 
But may be you should have given 5 rs tips.
| I understand it's become a natural instinct because rickshaw riders have history of charging unfairly that some people who charge fairly too take the hit. 

I have been bargaining when I was in college, but the moment I started earning I let that habit go especially in front of below poverty service providers like hawkers, rickshaw etc. I think I just got hyper aware of how their and our lives differ financially just because I had means to reach this job and they didn't. 

Funny story now I shamelessly ask for discounts at malls and big stores and you will be shocked they give it. Last buy was carvaaan in Croma, I showed them the Amazon price and asked them if they themselves would buy from their store. They matched the price. 

So point being save in malls and big box stores and spend without thinking too much on needy. 

You just gotta build a new habit. And thanks for being aware of it, you will do better next time.
-| That is really cool!!
I come from a privledged family and when I go for shopping I deliberately try to quote lower price just out of curiosity and stirring a reaction, and many times it results into a social convo and finally me getting some discounts.
| I do not bargain from road side sellers and these autorickshaw walas. If there is a possibility I book ola or uber or go with the price that uber gives and bargain in that case. You can be generous, but at the same time can be logical too. You are paying at an upscale restaurant for the experience you are getting. If the Auto Rickshaw has AC and all you can give any price they ask. That doesn't mean you have to be rude with them while bargaining, but just make a conscious decision on how you spend money. Because you are earning from your hard work like the auto rickshaw walla too
| I stopped even looking for Autos in chennai, because it’s never the fair ask rate and I hate to bargain. But when I go to different states like in Kerala where they use meters for fare - I hop on, I am comfortable
| A realisation similar to yours led me to never try to bargain small shopkeepers especially vegetable stalls (provided their prices are not exorbitant). You have to understand that they are often forced to sell at a slight premium because their inventories do not fly off the shelves like in supermarkets. However, I do refrain from doing business with those that charge unreasonable prices.
| I appreciate your honesty and like others have said we should be generous whenever we can. Good day to you OP
| If this is felt now later after all has happened then it means humour is there. 
This was the last and try to help as much as possible in future.
| The fact that you even recognised what you could have done better is a sign that your heart is in the right place 🙂

| It can be one of two things.

- one no one likes to be over charged. If it costs x and they charge more it’s effectively theft. 

- two of course it’s the negotiating position and the social context. You are comfortable negotiating with the rickshaw guy but not the restaurant obviously.


Ps personally I am happy to give to charity, and do. But no one can demand money off me. That I can afford it, is no basis for anyone to steal money off me.

I will still not tip in a restaurant if it’s bad service, and will happily tip extra if the auto or cab has gone the extra mile for me.
-| When you say.. 'It costs x and they charge more...' you are implying that there is a fixed cost to the thing.
Most of the times, atleast for services, there is no fixed cost.
| I have done the same mistake before. Feeling the guilt too. Will be more cautious next time
| I'm not bragging but I'm usually very generous towards these people. In my cases like these, i will give them 50 inr at the end of the ride and tell them to keep the change.

I am also a bargainer/negotiator too. Bargain heavily depend upon the transaction value.

Cases where i bargain heavily are salary raise/negotiations and hotel rent for longer stay
| My father doesn't shy from bargaining even in high-end restaurants. I remember once he tried to talk the manager into not making a *pakka bill* and thereby avoiding GST. My cousin was like "chachu, that doesn't happen". My father was persistent, in the end, we got GST waived off in the pakka bill as the same amount was deducted as "discount". My cousin was left bewildered and impressed.
| Man. I so relate to this. I had similar realisation some 3-4 years back. I had eaten a brunch with friends at an unnecessary expensive place. While returning my wife asked me to get some fruit. There i am standing and arguing with the guy for some banana and apple. He was particularly looking very tired and stressed. While i was haggling there came another lady who looked also struggling in life and she also started haggling with him(she may be justified i dont know her situation). She smiled at me in agreement and we ganged up on the guy. We got our way and we got fruits at discount. I left feeling happy and but then this realisation happened. I just stopped the car and pondered over it and felt like shit. I went and paid that guy the money he asked for. Since then I consciously avoid this in every sphere of life. Never haggle for with these poor vendors or rikshawala. Even when someone ask for money on road. I give them whatever i feel comfortable with. I genuinely try to give tip 10-15% to the waiters (unless it is already billed). We are way too privileged than almost 98% out there. What you said OP is so true. We all need to realise this. Thanks for sharing this.
| It's a human tendency to bargain where it can be bargained. The things which comes with fix price, we buy it at leisure or as a necessity .
| You felt bad for him. That should be it. You are better to many of us!

Just don't let it dry off. Goodluck on the road ahead.
| You didn't do anything bad. A price is a price. If you know it takes max 20, it takes 20.
You should not be throwing your money away for reason. A reasonable cost is a reasonable cost.
| This reminded me of the time when I first visited Delhi in 2015. I wasn't familiar with metro or DTC buses, thus opted for an Auto-rickshaw. Mf quoted Rs. 450 for a ride from NDLS to Okhla and even claimed its similar if we go by the meter. I was exhausted atm and decided on a whim to quote Rs. 300 (lol), and he agreed instantly. 

Do you know what the actual fare from meter is? 
Ans: Rs. 100-120

Moral: Fuck conscience! If you know Rs. 20 is optimum fare for your ride, then just go with it. People won't bat an eye before scamming you.
| It is a good thing that you consciously took time to think about this, but I do think you (or anyone) WOULD bargain for the pizza if there was a comfortable option for that, I don't think (hopefully!) what you bargained for necessarily comes from a place of "ego". Bargaining is not essentially a bad thing, the one on the other side could be way more privileged than you are, but yeah no need to hassle the already less privileged.
| Best post I read on Reddit. Truly unlocked a new section of my mind.
| Why are you assuming the auto driver is less privileged? There’s nothing unethical about bargaining. Unethical would be when you don’t pay him what you agreed to.  As for the restaurant, that’s completely independent. You saw the value for the food to be 2k, you paid for it just like you saw the value for that ride was 20 and you paid for it. There’s no point feeling bad about eating at the restaurant and spending 2k or comparing that with anything else.
| No harm in bargaining if you know the right rates OP. People are out to rip off those who are considerate and sensitive to other people's needs.
| Atleast u didn't pay tips at pizza place.u saved ₹10/ from poor guy. Ur a vise versa of Robinhood. 
Giving more to rich And taking from poor.
| Please find that guy and give him the 10Rs. You will feel good
-| how you suppose we will find him rich boi

not like we can contact uber support
| Why would anyone be proud doing that?
-| Yep yep. Just wanted to vent
| what did you eat of 2K? How big was this Rs 600 pizza? Was it gold foiled?
-| Even a loaded, large pizza from Pizza Hut costs at least Rs. 600 now.
--| Bro in my place even small pizza from piza hut is rs 600
-| It’s not that hard to reach 2k in a good restaurant real quick.
-| bro it is very normal for a above average restaurant to have 600 medium pizza, with drinks and ice cream and taxes it would be 1500 easy.
-| Teri kyu jal rhi hah?
--| Jali nahi hai. I am just curious because I earn just a bit above that e-rickshaw wala.
| It’s wise to be thrifty but not stingy
| Bro you never know why that guy agreed for 20rs, maybe he was in route to pick someone else.
| Simple reason. Your first reaction was because of your belief in power.  

You certainly felt that you could overpower that poor E-rickshaw guy. You felt yourself superior to him. 

Whereas you had no guts to do so with the upscale restaurant owner. You could not ask him why are they charging so high for a particular dish or drink. 

&#x200B;

Your second reaction came when your brain actually started working. It takes some time or more powerful force to overcome these impulsive reactions.
| It's because you don't see the rickshaw driver as an equal. You see him as someone below your level, so you are fine denying him basic minimum wages for his work. The restaurant on the other hand makes you feel good about yourself, and it highlights how you are privileged enough to eat at a more expensive place.
| I don't mind paying a bit extra. Unless its to Bangalore auto fuckers.

I've had a terrible time with them since long, well before I had somewhat enough, I would rather walk than give them a single rupee. Honestly hoping they die off or disappear as I do not consider them human anymore with how much I hate them.
| It would be great if we all bargained like this at these so called "upscale" stores and the premium prices they sell things at, wouldn't be premium anymore.
| It's okay, you're a dickhead, OP. 

Just try to not be a dickhead or a slave to big fat-cats next time, okay?
| I don't see anything wrong in this. Would you have bargained if the e-rickshaw was registered to an app like Uber? No, because you know everyone else will more or less be paying the same as you. With random e-rickshaw drivers, no one sets the price. Some amount of skepticism is acceptable. He's free to ask for anything ridiculously high, and you're free to offer anything ridiculously low, until both can agree upon a valid price. You're paying for a service, not doing charity. 

And believe it or not, some taxi/e-rickshaw drivers get slightly offended when you don't bargain with them.
| [deleted]
-| Lol this is the most senseless comment on this thread. What does frequency have to do with it?
--| [deleted]
---| First of all saving Rs. 200 on purchase of Rs. 2K one time is much more efficient than saving Rs. 10 20 times. This is because you will be bargaining just once and you are only asking for 10% reduction. For rickshaw puller it's 10 on 30 which is 33.33% reduction. You are still saving the SAME non-negligible amount.

Secondly, the only reason OP didn't bargain at the restaurant is OP would feel embarassed because no one else is doing it. And they might not even listen. They would say either eat or leave. On the other hand, bargaining with rickshaw and fruit vendor is a widely done practice and OP would not stand out even if someone sees him doing it.
| Should you really be enabling people to over charge because you're wealthy, would it not render fairly priced services expensive for the poor? 

The cost of a service is pegged according to what people can afford and what value it has in correspondence to the people of the entire country not just the wealthy. I'm not sure either but these are my initial thoughts.
| Well, that’s Predictably Irrational
| It’s ok your inner Gujarati leaked out
| Good that you questioned yourself. I have been in your situation before . With covid i have been generous to the working staff who earn min wage and usually tip them.
| I had the exact same feeling a few years ago. Stopped bargaining since then. Sometimes I even tip them on top of the agreed amount. Its nothing compared to what we spend on a restaurant or in a mall, so I figured why not.
| yup. and after hearing those margins for fancy food items on shark tank...
| It's fine man don't feel guilty. It's okay to like something and pay handsomely for it. You don't have to be generous to whole world.
| Sounds like a you problem
| It's because we have grown up watching the same things that it's gotten into our blood. Similarly, ordering pizza for Rs. 600 is something we have seen our friends do, so that's normal as well.

But don't worry, intelligence happens from doubt and questioning. And deep thinking eventually leads to change.
| I'd think 30 rupees is super cheap for a motorised vehicle drop. Bargaining for a 33% discount feels a bit much. Specially when you can afford the fee. 

Normally I'd bargain for a rickshaw if I knew they were overcharging above market rates. And I'd only spend 2k on the meal if I felt the ingredients, skill of preparation and venue warranted it. 

Ultimately you want to fairly compensate everyone, only then are you not left with this bad feeling of having cheated or been cheated. From your post it seems you felt the rickshaw driver was asking a fair price and you paid him less while the restaurant charged more than was fair but you still paid up, because you could bully the former with your status and the latter could bully you with its status. So you ended up feeling awful.

Some interesting studies with apes showed that even our evolutionary cousins have a sense of fairness in transactions and get upset when this idea isn't upheld, so it's a deep rooted instinct.
| Like i understand, but i really wanna know whats the solution to this problem?

How we gonn create justice in these cases where no one negotiates while buying 70k iphone, but while buying the vegetables from small vendors
| Not bargaining with the rickshaw isnt the complete solution, but paying 2k at the restaurant should also be fixed, i just don't know how
| I know few rikshaw driver .
And they don't earn much in my town.
Because of new CNG pump there are way more rikshaw driver now then ever , unfortunately there aren't more people now .
Few driver I spoke to told me that they at most get 30-50 in town per ride ,then they have to get back in line of rikshaw stand .
Whatever to  they earn they always spend a part on cng and maintenance , with remaining to themselves or a part of it to owner of rikshaw if they work in rent vehicle.
That been said I have encountered many rude and irresponsible drive as well , so that makes even sometimes.
| Did I bargain just because I knew that the less privileged driver was an easy target to polish my ego on? -- Yes. But on the brighter side, that fact that you realize the problem is good enough. We all make mistakes!
| 600 for a pizza? 59 gets you a nice pizza mania 4 piecer.
| brother you're sensitive it's nice.. the world needs more like you
| *me a Kolkata guy wonders how rickshaws have meters wen our local cabs don't
| I was in a similar situation yesterday but I chose not to bargain. The auto driver said "100 hoga" but i reflexively opposed with "100 nai hota hai bhaiya" and to my surprise, instead of arguing he said "kitna doge?" I shot my shot with 60 and he said 80 and my head went into a rapid dialogue  " Should I bargain for 60 or go with 80? I dont think twice before ordering food online or buying expensive electronics... Those are the big corporations actually looting us and this is a regular person with a family to feed...we visit these posh outlets and ironically avoid bargaining to save our image which is so wrong. The fuel prices are skyrocketing anyway. I should've been okay with even 100. Okay I won't bargain."
| It takes courage to admit our own mistakes, you just did that. 

I am very happy for you, you won't do the same mistake again.

Btw, i wonder, what changed your heart??? These types of realizations are very rare these days.
| Restaurant was certainly not worth it and sometimes those drivers do demand unreasonable price but they also work so hard. It's a dilemma to me.
| Kyuki agar tu restaurant me bargain karta to vo kehte- " itne ka hi pizza hai, aapko lena hai to lo warna jaa sakte hai". And your bargaining with auto wala is kindoff justified, because for that distance 20 rs was optimal charge. Maybe that's the circle rate, other autos would also be taking that much money. So when he asked for 30 rs, it triggered you.
| People don't bargain at the restaurant because they would feel embarassed as no one else is doing it. And they might not even listen. They would say either eat or leave. They might give a discount depending on restaurant sales. But most of us don't even try. On the other hand, bargaining with rickshaw and fruit vendor is a widely done practice and we would not stand out even if someone see us doing it. We have seen people do it around us that's why it feel so natural.
| Andar ki aatma jaag gai 🤣
| Post-tuktuk clarity
| Its nice enough that you are contemplating on your actions bro. Its made me look back on my share of similar assholery. But lets try to be more human the next time. Jai hind.
| So you bargained 13 cents on a 40 cents ride. Okay
| Make sure next time you will do good 👍 
Don’t bargain with folks whose life depends on your business and also always buy local, avoid all chain stores
| OP doing justice to his username
| badey paise jaate nhi dikhte hai, but when you pay small then you will feel it.
| I used to try to explain this shit to my mom back in the day. Like haggling for a couple of Rs over vegetables just seemed so arbitrary when literally we just went out for lunch. I think there is some zero sum game that goes in our mind. If I spend more here, I need to somehow compensate elsewhere regardless of whether the other situation has someone more in need of money. I get haggling when you know the prices they are charging are outrageous but I don't think it makes any sense for people who make very little.
| Am a bad person who thinks capitalism is the way. So I don't bargain unless the person is straight trying to scam me. 10-20 rs won't affect me anymore plus it would result in more cash flow. So it's a small win for economy. Tip 20-30 rs to people if you like the service provided by them.
| It's in your blood.
| One thing I have noticed is we often do not judge or question when someone has listed their price on a Menu or display card, this makes you think you are obliged to pay that amount if you want to get the goods or service, however if someone verbally tells us the price, we try to bargain or negotiate. If this was a different scenario where he charged you on meter basis, you would have paid him the 30 Rs.
Anyway I think it's considerate of you to think about this and whenever you come across the less fortunate and needy, you try to pay more when you can and if you feel it's right
| That’s why rickshaws without meters suck! (Maharashtra here)
| Its not just about saving 10 rupees but rather a fixed value of a service. 
You don't bargain with autos if they run on meter, 
You don't haggle with street vendors who sell you golgappas or other items

Its more about what is moral, and they are not being moral by not running meters and instead bullying you to pay above the fixed cost. I think everyone loses in this situation. You lose by either getting forced to pay extra or use a booking app which takes 5-10 minutes of your time. They lose by getting less customers. Only these apps are at a profit.

If you have ever been to Mumbai, there auto wallahs are generally richer than the ones in delhi, or the rest of India, primarily because it is much easier to take autos there as everyone runs on meter. Sometimes the autos are even expensive than cabs but people still take them due to their easy availability.
| Why? Customer experience!
| Chhodo bhai

Galtiyon ka putla hai insaan 🗿
| If you see this next time just pay some extra. At the end of the day he is just trying to survive and the situation is not like that you don’t have money, you just spend 2k on a meal.
| Yeah man, you are a scumbag. Sounds harsh, but its objectively true (not dissing you, I am one too). In a city like Bangalore, a rickshaw driver makes about 5,000 - 9,000rs/month and pays about rs 2000-5000/month in rent. Net savings (per the study linked below) per day are 300-500. 10Rs was about 3% of his daily earnings. If he drives 10 hours a day, you would have saved him about 20 mins of work.  
https://www.dmwevehicles.com/rickshaw/often-asked-how-much-does-a-rickshaw-driver-make-in-india.html  
Bargaining with people who have less leverage and economic power than you is inherently scummy.
| The reason - You saw the face of the person who is the decision maker on the other side... that you can bargain with.

In the restaurant, the prices are on the menu. The waiter can't change it and you won't be reaching out to restaurant manager to bargain.

In a supermarket, the prices are already marked and the person billing does not own the place... he/she is just doing the billing.

Regarding autorickshaw, the person driving it is the owner and can change the price.

If you had booked a rickshaw on an app that tells you the price, and you have to pay on app, and the driver is not the owner of his own business, but just a worker... you would not have bargained.

Remove the access of consumer from the owner, and your potential to bargain goes away.

**Think about it**.
| I try and take a different approach when availing such services. I try and be aware of the price going around in the market, if it is within a range I get it without saying a word.

When i don't know the fair price, haggle a bit to ensure that I am not being taken for a toss and pay a little over the settled price.

| What a coincidence, me and my gf were out today and I bargained with a rickshaw wala for 30 rs instead of 40, and my gf scolded me, and I had a moment of guilt there. We had just come after shopping for over 10k.
| I've seen people buying inflated fruits and veggies at Reliance Fresh and asking for free cilantro from the local hawkers. It's a shame!
| Thing is We all wanted to be treated equally. Pizza you had will be priced same for anyone like you. We just get the doubt when rickshaw driver or anyone fix the price of the product or service is same and we are treated equally like anyone. Why didn’t you feel that way for pizza shop, coz fare is same for everyone.

There is nothing wrong in bargaining when the fare of the good or service you receive makes you feel unfair. Cheer it man.
| Penny wise, Pound foolish. This what my grandad used to say we all Indians suffer from. You’re not alone out there.

| I live in Bangalore, 30 rupee fare was a neat fare back in 2005. Now they say 300 without blinking.
| I value my money so my consideration towards it is directly proportional to the amount involved. I would prolly try hard to get the pizza on a deal but rarely bargain with a street seller, hawker or drivers. On the contrary I tip them generously to get that smile back. I can afford to lose 100 bucks here and there without bothering myself, so might as well lose it on someone needy.
| I felt that. And yes been there done that. But I guess for me it was not a case of ego or anything. I always feel guilty spending huge amounts on food/drinks as I come from a middle class family. It's more like ..saving the 10 rupees gives me a sense of what? I don't know the English term for it  I can't think anymore.
| DUDE ITS OKAY TO BARGAIN.

You paying Rs. 30 there brings up the price for everyone else who might not be as rich as you. So yeah bargain anywhere you can.
| You have no idea how many times it just happens. You are willing to spend money at a fancy restaurant but not to get there. I mean I do to. Today I asked rickshaw waala bhaiyya to bargain it down to 60 from 100. I felt terrible but while I was travelling I overheard his conversation he was struggling to pay rent. Idk it shook me. He was returning the money for the change I said keep it. I mean I come from a middle class family that 100 was for very short distance but I believe I have put up a good deed, it shaal return to me sooner rather than later.

Next time OP!

Life will give you a chance again!
| Indeed, in the retrospect it feels bad, but let bygones be bygones and try to be more generous in future :)
| Trampling on the poor instead of confronting the rich is why India is stuck in the 1800s
| My bargaining skills are so broken I end up overpaying :/
| First of all, I've been dirt poor before so, let me ask you this. Did he tell you he was underprivileged? Did he ask you to show him pity? You assumed he was poor and in need of your mercy. You can write a lot of words but that's just a power trip. Offering unwarranted pity is the favorite pastime of upper middle class kids. r/LookatMyHalo


You would bargain at restaurants if they didn't have fixed prices. And restaurants can and have shut down and disappear because they raised their prices. Outside restaurants, have you ever heard of this word called "negotiating" when buying or selling something? It's not exploiting the underprivileged. I think you've read too many reddit comments for your own good.
-| COVID has disproportionately affected the informal economy. It might be wrong to assume that he was underprivileged, but should be right to assume that COVID has impacted him a lot more than it has impacted me. Which is why I felt bad after having bargained with him for a petty sum of money.

Also, I'm not sure if you stay in India, but if you do, you would be aware that due to the lack of formal vocational education, there's a clear correlation of the type of job that one does with one's economic status. One can easily estimate the amount of earnings an e-rickshaw driver would have in a metro city, and especially during COVID it does bring them on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. It is wrong to conclude from here that they're in need of anyone's 'mercy', but that is not what my post implies.

Also, did I tell you that I was an upper middle class kid? You assumed I was one! Even if I were, why be so harsh?
| I had a same experience 15 years back, haunting me still today. I was young and stupid
| Username checks out.

This is fairly common and happens all the time. It's psychological conditioning over our lifetimes that governs our perception on what we must pay for something. And humans are infact very irrational when it comes to shit like this. Check out the the [paradox of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value) for another stupid thing humans do.

I had a similar 'epiphany' sometime back when I was smoking outside and a beggar passed me by. I was glued to my phone at the time and ignored him. But after he went away, I realized how irrational I was being, especially since I was trying cut down on cigarettes and used to stub them halfway and throw them away. I ignored the beggar not because of any apparent stinginess on my part as I could have easily bought a smaller cigarette/smoked fewer instead of halves and given away the saved money to him. It was clearly because of inconvenience.

We sometimes try to rationalize such behaviour to ourselves by believing that beggars/poor people are lazy, or will use the money to spend it on alcohol/drugs but that's not really true if one is being honest with themselves. Hell, as someone trying to cut down on smoking who was I to judge their behaviour anyway?

I have since kept a lot of change in my pocket/wallet so that I do not weasel out of ignoring beggars because it's inconvenient. You'd be surprised at how miniscule a hole it makes in your wallet. When I checked after a month, I'd given lesser than I spent on smokes daily.
| My bargaining skills are so broken I end up overpaying :/
| Well what I think is that when you are stepping into a similar kind of a restaurant, it's like you expect the price to be higher. Like you've already made up your mind and you know that it is going to cost you a bit of money and also the prices at that places don't change relatively, like you know that a margarita will cost me x amount at dominos whether I eat it today, tomorrow or a month from now.

Coming to the rick situation it's like you know that this distance is going to cost you 20 bucks and that is what you have in mind already but when you hear that the price is not what you expected and that is what conditions us to bargain it down. 

And plus there is also a factor of not being able to bargain price at such establishments.
| I don't think that bargaining is a problem. I make decent money, but I would bargain where possible. There are less privileged folks who would also want to use the same services and if people like me drive the prices up, then it hurts the others.

  
What I do often is that I end up giving someone extra money after the service if they rendered the service to my satisfaction or delight. Even if I had bargained in the beginning.
| 1. Bargaining for one thing and not the other = clarifies how much of our brain assigns value for them. Value = psychological satisfaction here

2. Bargaining can occur 
a) if one knows they are being overcharged
b) habitual

3. You already know the ethics to it, the rick guy's whole Rs 30 could be his bread for the day in contrast to a mere carrying bag for the pizza. When we can afford it for the pizza, why not for bread earner.

Hope the above helps you make future bargain decisions

P.S. A bargain averting person, also very bad at it. In my defense its mostly online purchases these days where I can do my research beforehand.

Don't bargain with  poor vegetable ,fruit sellers etc and especially when they are women and elderly.We do not know what difficulty they may be facing.Same with rickshaw drivers Always say thank you with a smile at the end of the journey.Give alms to the elderly, the blind and lepers.These people  are the abandoned in our society.She also made it a point to buy a little extra fruit, biscuits etc and give to our security man when we got back from our shopping trips .The surprise and huge smiles are a blessing to us .
| Once I was going back home at night. The auto rickshaw driver asked me ₹150 and I bargained it to ₹100. While we were on the way I felt that the distance did justify more than ₹100 and since it was night time there was less chance of him getting another customer on the way back. I ended up giving him ₹150. Don't sweat on it OP. It happens to all of us sometimes. It's good that you realised it so you won't be doing the same mistake in future.
| That's exactly what i do and exactly how i feel.

If you would be so generous to add the most appropriate comment for your question in your post? it will be helpful, I(many) would like to know
| Bet u are a girl
| The most important thing is that you reflected on it and realised that it was a bit classist to haggle with someone just because you know you could. Next time, only haggle if you think you're being cheated and be generous with those less well off than you.


Nice man.
| I'm a black american with a gujarati wife. Their whole family bargains.

Having a thrifty mindset is good, but there are too many times where people will bargain because of the principle of it. They don't care about the amount as much as feeling like they got a deal. I've seen my father in law walk away from really good deals just because they didn't agree to his price. It's honestly sort of ridiculous.

Example. Something might be worth 30k. It's being sold for 24k. Already a great deal. They offer 20k. Seller says it's literally worth 30k so they're not budging. Deal isn't made.

Similar thing worth 30k. Seller says 29k. They offer 27k. Seller accepts. They paid 3k more just because they "got a bargain."

So yea, stop stiffing the driver that is living on shit when it has zero impact on your financial standing. Pay the 30 and tip him if you're able. You'll get better service, be remembered fondly, and you'll get good karma out of it.
| I was in a hurry once and wanted to take an e-rikshaw so I asked for the price. He asked for Rs50 and I immediately tried the bargaining technique where you just walk away without saying anything and expect him to call you back and offer a lower price. The moment I did, he called me and kindly asked "What happened? You didn't even say anything" with a smile. I felt so bad doing that. I should have just asked for a lower price before walking away. I felt like I was rude to him. He agreed to the lower price instantly and was very polite. I ended up paying him the original amount without the discount because I felt bad.
| Bargaining comes out of habit, and is hard to shake. You can simply pay the original amount asked or even more after you've finished bargaining and realized what you've done.
| Since I don't travel enough, I let them have it just because I'm at a better place than him. If he overcharges me, I still let them have it thinking he might be having a requirement. 

They should grow as well. Today, they're manually cycling. Tomorrow, they'll have an e-rickshaw. Few months later, they might buy an auto or a cab. (If that's the field they want to be in)

They grow with our contribution :)
| I never understood why people did it, and I don’t do it unless I think someone’s trying to scam me. Why do people think it’s okay to try and take like 5rs off of a vegetable vendor who already have it tough. Good for you to think so.
| Its human nature, we been programmed since childhood to take advantage or take almost everything for granted including our parents. At high end restaurant we cant bargain so we don't but we can bargain with a self employed, even if he is a minimum wage worker , so we do. Its a sad reality.
| Used to do this / versions of this all the time. Eat in TGIF. Bargain with vegetable seller the next day. Fly to Thailand for a bachelors party. Then bargain with artists in Dilli Haat next week. 

Realized one day just how lucky and privileged I actually am. Since then I have stopped bargaining with ppl I consider less fortunate than me. Instead I "negotiate" in posh hotels and while buying electronics. Ppl are shocked by how often I am able to knock 10 - 20 % off a bill in Taj or Chroma just by asking.
| Didn't know auto fares can be bargained with in other states. Here in Kolkata, the fares are fixed for each route.

I've just stopped bargaining for things below Rs100 post pandemic. People lost a lot of business due to COVID so just let them make it back as ethically as possible.
| The fact that you realise this and are contemplating on it is enough for now. Don't fret over what has already happened. 
Thumb rule - If you do not bat an eyelid for a ₹600 pizza, be more considerate towards the groups for whom ₹10 is a significant percentage of their daily earning.
| Now you have woken up!  Now you can make a better choice next time.

Also: if you can save just Rs. 100 at some fancy dinner, then it pays for five or ten times you can be generous to someone poor.
| Please don't bargain got 20-30rs.
| Did you go to the restaurant alone or were you in a Group? Because like, not trying to be rude but, what did you eat that lol? 600 for a pizza?
| I don't know you. But I'm proud of you. Whoever you are. For even questioning yourself about this behavior or yours. If only we all questioned and reflected on ourselves and our deeds, the world would be a better place. <3
| You’re not comparing apples with apples. One is a more transparent system with upfront communication on pricing. Other is flexible and open for bargaining. If going for 20 rather than 30 doesn’t work for the driver, he would have said no. Like for example if you’re buying garments at a place that’s not a big chain (like Pantaloons), there’s always some room to bargain. If you say 300 when the seller says 1000, then you have no deal because it probably costs him 250 and he is assured of finding a gullible customer who’ll not bargain or bargain up to 600 rupees and no lower. But if you say 700 and he agrees, you’re not conning him for 300 rupees.  

Rickshaw is a low-priced product / service, but the concept still holds. Is it having transparent and consistent pricing? If not, then there’s room to negotiate and you can safely assume that the driver won’t go if you’re lowballing him. Plus, he will recover that by charging 40 instead of 30 for the next equivalent trip, especially if that customer isn’t aware of what’s acceptable and what’s not.
